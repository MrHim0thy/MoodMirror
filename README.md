MoodMirror: Emotion-Based Music Playlist Generator

MoodMirror is a personalized music web app that uses the Spotify API to generate daily playlists based on your emotional state. By logging your mood, the app curates a playlist that either reflects your current feeling or counterbalances it â€” helping you lean into your emotions or lift yourself out of them.

Features:
    Mood Logging: Choose from moods like happy, sad, anxious, energized, calm, etc.
    Reflect or Flip Mode: Match your mood or intentionally shift it with contrasting vibes.
    Spotify Integration: Generates playlists using real-time Spotify data, including audio              features like valence, energy, and tempo.
    Mood Tracker (Coming Soon): Visualize your emotional patterns and playlist history over time.
